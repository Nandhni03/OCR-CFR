# React + Vite Project

Welcome to your new React project powered by Vite! This template provides a minimal setup to get you started with React using Vite, ensuring a fast and smooth development experience with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some basic ESLint rules.

## Features

- **Vite for Blazing Fast Development**: Enjoy a super fast development environment with Vite, which leverages native ES modules for rapid cold starts and instant hot module replacement (HMR).
- **React Integration**: Seamless integration with React, making it easy to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Experience instant feedback with HMR, allowing you to see changes in realtime without losing your application's state.
- **ESLint for Code Quality**: Basic ESLint rules are included to help maintain code quality and consistency.

## Plugins

This template offers two official plugins to enhance your development experience:

- **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)**: Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)**: Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

Choose the plugin that best fits your needs and preferences. Both offer excellent performance and compatibility with modern React development.
